# Server-Sent Events (SSE)

- only one way communication (server to client)
- simple to implement and use compared to WebSockets. It’s built on standard HTTP protocols and doesn’t require special handling for connections.

# WebSocket

- bi-directional communication between client and server
- suitable for interactive apps
- low latency
- more complex setup

## Example use cases

App needs to receive and send data in real-time

- collaborative tools (Figma, document editing)
- games
- trading
- chat
